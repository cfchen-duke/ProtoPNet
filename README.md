# ProtoPNet

This code package implements the prototypical part network (ProtoPNet)
from the paper "This Looks Like That: Deep Learning for Interpretable Image Recognition"
(to appear at NeurIPS 2019), by Chaofan Chen* (Duke University), Oscar Li* (Duke University),
Chaofan Tao (Duke University), Alina Jade Barnett (Duke University),
Jonathan Su (MIT Lincoln Laboratory), and Cynthia Rudin (Duke University)
(* denotes equal contribution).

and the distribution of this code package).

Prerequisites: PyTorch, NumPy, cv2, Augmentor (https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor)
Recommended hardware: 4 NVIDIA Tesla P-100 GPUs or 8 NVIDIA Tesla K-80 GPUs

Instructions for preparing the data:
1. Download the dataset CUB_200_2011.tgz from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html
2. Unpack CUB_200_2011.tgz
3. Crop the images using information from bounding_boxes.txt (included in the dataset)
4. Split the cropped images into training and test sets, using train_test_split.txt (included in the dataset)
5. Put the cropped training images in the directory "./datasets/cub200_cropped/train_cropped/"
6. Put the cropped test images in the directory "./datasets/cub200_cropped/test_cropped/"
7. Augment the training set using img_aug.py (included in this code package)
   -- this will create an augmented training set in the following directory:
      "./datasets/cub200_cropped/train_cropped_augmented/"

Instructions for training the model:
1. In settings.py, provide the appropriate strings for data_path, train_dir, test_dir,
train_push_dir:
(1) data_path is where the dataset resides
    -- if you followed the instructions for preparing the data, data_path should be "./datasets/cub200_cropped/"
(2) train_dir is the directory containing the augmented training set
    -- if you followed the instructions for preparing the data, train_dir should be data_path + "train_cropped_augmented/"
(3) test_dir is the directory containing the test set
    -- if you followed the instructions for preparing the data, test_dir should be data_path + "test_cropped/"
(4) train_push_dir is the directory containing the original (unaugmented) training set
    -- if you followed the instructions for preparing the data, train_push_dir should be data_path + "train_cropped/"
2. Run main.py

Instructions for finding the nearest prototypes to a test image:
1. Run local_analysis.py and supply the following arguments:
-gpuid is the GPU device ID(s) you want to use (optional, default '0')
-modeldir is the directory containing the model you want to analyze
-model is the filename of the saved model you want to analyze
-imgdir is the directory containing the image you want to analyze
-img is the filename of the image you want to analyze
-imgclass is the (0-based) index of the correct class of the image

Instructions for finding the nearest patches to each prototype:
1. Run global_analysis.py and supply the following arguments:
-gpuid is the GPU device ID(s) you want to use (optional, default '0')
-modeldir is the directory containing the model you want to analyze
-model is the filename of the saved model you want to analyze

Instructions for pruning the prototypes from a saved model:
1. Run run_pruning.py and supply the following arguments:
-gpuid is the GPU device ID(s) you want to use (optional, default '0')
-modeldir is the directory containing the model you want to prune prototypes from
-model is the filename of the saved model you want to prune prototypes from
Note: the prototypes in the model must already have been projected (pushed) onto
the nearest latent training patches, before running this script

Instructions for combining several ProtoPNet models (Jupyter Notebook required):
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook combine_models.ipynb
